graf
====
Our beloved graf has recently had its horrible, horrible hackathon code ripped out, and is now being redesigned as a highly modular, scalable, and stable project -- with the backend in Python instead of Node.js!

If you want to check out the original version, check under the branch `original_graf`

Note: unfortunately, all of the frontend js is still a hacked together abomination screaming "kill me!"
